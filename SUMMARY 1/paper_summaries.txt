Paper Reading and writing summaries
-------------------------------------------------------

Here is some good advice on reading papers, by Keshav: http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf

This advice is geared towards researchers and reviewers. For the purpose of this class, you do not have to worry about references etc. 

The important take away is to read the paper in multiple stages

Stage 1: A quick reading of the introduction and the conclusion. You should know what the paper is about.

Stage 2: A slightly more thorough reading. This time, your goal is to understand what the authors main contributions/claims are. The second goal is to understand the techniques/solutions used by the authors.

Stage 3: Now write down all evidence you need to support the authors claims.  A final reading to see if the authors have enough support for their claims.

Your project summaries should have the following information:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is the problem? 

2. What are the contributions in the paper? 

3. What are the conclusions in the paper and how do the authors support their conclusions (for example using measurement study, experimentation, analysis, modeling, etc). 

4. What did you like about the paper (or what is the one new/cool thing you learnt from the paper)

5. What did you not like about the paper? Is there something you dont agree with the paper? (or how can you improve the paper)

The summary should be no more than 1 page. Any format is ok and if you summary goes a few lines extra or less than 1 page that is ok. But please use a font of at least 10 or above to spare my eyesight. Please proof-read your summaries. 

Most importantly, do not plagiarize. Do not lift sentences from the paper. Every sentence you write should be your own. I take plagiarism very seriously and will give you a zero if you verbatim lift sentences from the paper.
